        <h2> Moon River Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
            Moon river, wider than a mile
            <br>I'm crossing you in style some day
            <br>Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
            <br>Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
            <br>Two drifters, off to see the world
            <br>There's such a lot of world to see
            <br>We're after the same rainbow's end
            <br>Waitin' 'round the bend
            <br>My huckleberry friend
            <br>Moon river and me
        </p>
        <h2> Pink+ White Lyrics </h2>
        <p>
            That's the way everyday goes
            <br>Every time we've no control
            <br>If the sky is pink and white
            <br>If the ground is black and yellow
            <br>It's the same way you showed me
            <br>Nod my head, don't close my eyes
            <br>Halfway on a slow move
            <br>It's the same way you showed me
            <br>If you could fly then you'd feel south
            <br>Up north's getting cold soon
            <br>The way it is, we're on land
            <br>So I'm someone to hold true
            <br>Keep you cool when it's still alive
            <br>Won't let you down when it's all ruin
            <br>Just the same way you showed me, showed me
            <br>You showed me love
            <br>Glory from above
            <br>Regard my dear
            <br>t's all downhill from here
            <br>In the wake of a hurricane
            <br>Dark skin of a summer shade
            <br>Nosedive in the flood lines
            <br>Tall tower of milk crates
            <br>It's the same way you showed me
            <br>Cannonball off the porch side
            <br>Older kids trying off the roof
            <br>Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
            <br>If you could die and come back to life
            <br>Up for air from the swimming pool
            <br>You'd kneel down to the dry land
            <br>Kiss the Earth that birthed you
            <br>Gave you tools just to stay alive
            <br>And make it out when the sun is ruined
            <br>That's the same way you showed me, showed me
            <br>You showed me love
            <br>Glory from above
            <br>Regard my dear
            <br>It's all downhill from here
            <br>Remember life
            <br>Remember how it was
            <br>Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
            <br>Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
            <br>Say what up to Danny
            <br>Say what up to life immortality
            <br>Bending up my Nikes
            <br>Running out the melpomene, nicotine
            <br>Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
            <br>Gimme something sweet
            <br>Bitch, I might like immortality
            <br>This is life, life immortality
        </p>
