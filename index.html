    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>Hope you're having a good day!</p>
    <h3> Here is a little about me</h3>
    <p>My name is <strong>BELLA</strong></p>
    <p>I am from Jacksonville, Florida and like <em>long walks on the beach</em> and the Jacksonville Jaguars (even if they never win a game). But the Colorado mountains are growing on me and I have always been a big skiier so I'm excited for the upcoming ski season! </p>
    <p>My goal is to create a cool website for a photography portfolio. I also want to learn more about the color manipulation for text</p>
    <p>Here is a cool Youtube video: </p>
