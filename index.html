    <title>ABOUT THE CREATOR</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p># My name is **Bella** (She/Her)</p>
    <p>I am from Jacksonville, Florida and like *long walks on the beach* and the Jacksonville Jaguars (even if they never win a game)</p>
    <p>But the Colorado mountains are growing on me and I have always been a big skiier so I'm excited for the upcoming ski season</p>
    <p>## My goal is to create a cool website for a photography portfolio</p>
    <p> I also want to learn more about the color manipulation for text</p>
    <p> Here is a ~~cool~~ Youtube Video</p>
